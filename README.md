<h1>File Operations Playground</h1>

<p>This is a basic file IO application, written as my first basic foray into Python3. You will need to decide on a file to run. Right now, focus on either a Python file, a Javascript file, or possibly a plaintext file. To run the application, simply run `python3 app.py <filename>`.</p>
